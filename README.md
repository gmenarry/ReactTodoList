# This is my Todo list. 

I have created a simple Todo list using React. Some features include: 

* Adding and removing from the list
* Striking through each item on the list incase you want to mark them as complete but save them for later


Eventually, I would like to be able to add the follofing features: 

* The ability to link my Todo list to a database in order to save lists for a later date
* Add a time stamp to and items added
* Add a sign in page to allow different users to log in/out
* Add the ability to add labels to each item i.e. personal, work etc... 

Whilst my Todo list is simple, i have created it in App.js however, once i decide to expand on it's features, I will add components and seperate each ones making it manageable.
